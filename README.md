Raindrops
=========

Raindrops will be falling at even intervals. The goal of the game is to catch the raindrops using the catcher, which moves with the mouse. For each raindrop the player catches, the score increases by 1 point. If the player fails to catch a raindrop, he or she will lose 1 of a total 3 lives.
